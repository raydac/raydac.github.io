    <h1>Igor Maznitsa's home page</h1>
    <div class="oldstyled">Hello, I am a programming engineer from Tallinn (Estonia, it is a very very small Baltic country) where I have been living with my family since 2013, before I lived in Saint-Petersburg (Russia) where I was born in 1975. Programming is not only my daily work but also my main hobby. I started programming in 1988 when I was a pupil in a soviet 421 school of Leningrad city and we used BK-0010-01 school computers to learn computer science, then I spent many years to develop miscellaneous software as an amateur and only since 1997 I have been working as a professional software engineer. Mainly since 1999 I use Java platform as the base for my software developments from mobile projects to enterprise government level solutions. Also I have experience in different computer languages and even have experience in development of enterprise we based system in FORTH language. I am very lazy person and believe that programming is the main tool which sent by The God to laziness people, I am not programming for my pleasure but I am trying to transfer my daily tasks to computer's back through my knowledge and skills. Sometime I think that modern programmers are successors of medieval alchemist because mainly they have the same targets: both development of philosopher's stone and creation of homunculus (the last one I like much more than the first one).</div>

    <div class="oldstyled">The Last section contains links to misc old and very old stuff which may be is still interesting for somebody and I keep it mainly for back compatibility with the previous version of my home page. I just made some small descriptions and screen-shots from old developments and applications in which development I took a part and which had some more or less rich GUI. For non-game applications I made some small reference, but for games only screen-shots.</div>
