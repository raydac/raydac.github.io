        <h1>Chronicles of Igor Maznitsa</h1>

        <div class="oldstyled">In days of yore, I came into this world and was reared in a now-forgotten realm called
            Leningrad, once the second grandest city of the USSR. My tale begins within the halls of School 421, where,
            in
            the year of our Lord 1987, I embarked on a wondrous journey of enlightenment in the mystical art of
            programming,
            within the sanctum of the educational and production combine. For two cycles of the seasons, I delved into
            the
            arcane scrolls of BASIC, conjuring code for the mystical contraption known as the BK-0010. My heart was so
            enamored with the mystical art of coding that I delved ever deeper into the ancient tomes of computer
            languages
            and architectures, vowing to intertwine my life with the enigmatic craft of programming. Yet, by the hand of
            destiny, my talents did not align with the path of a true programmer within the hallowed walls of the
            technomancer's academy. Instead, I found myself compelled to embrace the role of a radio sorcerer, a
            technician
            of the ethereal waves.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="miniature"><img src="./images/illustration2.png" alt="Childred at computer tables"></div>
        <br />

        <div class="oldstyled">After my service in the army, I was summoned to toil for a company skilled in the
            conjuring
            of computer spells. There, I earned my keep with the craft I had mastered. My maiden foray into the realm of
            commercial programming involved the enchanting language known as Delphi. However, in the year of our Lord
            1999,
            I embarked upon a quest to explore a new and wondrous sorcery known as Java, henceforth inscribing my
            incantations solely in this bewitching, nascent art of computer magic. Many a computer spell I did conjure.
            From
            the year 2001 to 2007, my efforts were primarily devoted to crafting enchanting games for mobile telephonic
            devices. Dozens of these games were birthed, and my tale even found its place within the tome known as "The
            History of Finnish Video Games." As I forged these mobile games, I did not forsake the realm of enterprise,
            for
            I crafted systems of program conjuration and ethereal solutions for the servers. Yet, deep within my heart,
            there lay a yearning for the mysteries of artificial intelligence and the quest for the meaning of life. In
            the
            year of our Lord 2010, I, at long last, embarked on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Prolog language,
            a
            craft that left me spellbound with its mystical abilities.

        <div class="oldstyled">On mine thought, the contemporary crafters of code art do inherit the mantle of those
            ancient
            sorcerers who wrought in the Middle Ages. Their quests still dwell in the fashioning of the philosopher's
            stone
            and the homunculus. Such tasks did they pursue yore, they labor now, and they shall labor henceforth.

        <div class="miniature"><img src="./images/illustration5.png" alt="Alchemist with daemon"></div>
        <br />


        <div class="oldstyled">In the year 2013, I came to a realization that the land of Russia, in which I had dwelt,
            had
            fallen under the sway of malevolent forces and was descending into darkness. I resolved to embark on a
            journey
            to another blessed, albeit small, realm known as Estonia, where it was whispered that the arcane arts of
            computer science thrived and programmers found solace. Taking my kin with me, I relocated to the ancient
            city of
            Tallinn, nestled upon the shores of the Baltic Sea, to labor within a renowned startup, crafting spells of
            code
            for fellow magicians of the digital realm. In this new land, my life flourished, and I, in the comfort of my
            abode, began to weave enchantments of open-source code, which I bestowed upon the people to bring them joy
            and
            wisdom.

        <br />

        <div class="oldstyled">Since that time, I have dwelt in the realm of Estonia, partaking of bread and quaffing
            ale,
            which I wish upon all of you as well. And should anyone wish to peruse my chronicles in the scrolls of
            social
            networks, you are most welcome to follow the links to those realms. But if any heart desires to behold my
            dearest enchantments, let it not hesitate to press the button and journey to the repository of code. And if
            one's soul finds delight therein, let them offer me a small pouch of gold for ale and solace, that I may
            know my
            labor is both worthy and true.

For non-game applications I made some small descriptions, but for games only screen-shots because that's enough for arcade games.
