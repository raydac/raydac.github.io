      <h1>Igor Maznitsa's home page</h1>
    <div class="oldstyled">I am a programming engineer, since 2013 I have been living in Tallinn (Estonia), before I lived in Saint-Petersburg (Russia) where I was born in 1975. Programming is not only my daily work but it is also my hobby and life style. I started programming in 1988 as I was a pupil in 421th school of Leningrad city, my first programming platform was  BK-0010-01 (some clone of PDP-11 platform), after I spent many years to d
        
        evelop miscellaneous software as an amateur and in  1997 I started work as a junior programming engineer in small company "Information Technologies and Models". Delphi was my first commercial programming language but in 1999 I tasted Java platform and now it is my main developing platform (I worked with it in wide spectre of projects from mobile projects to goverment-level projects). Also I got some experience in different computer languages and even in development of enterprise web based system in FORTH language. I am not sure in bright future of Java and investigate another technologies and languages like Golang and Elixir.
          
        I am a very lazy person and believe that programming is the main tool which sent by The God to laziness people, mainly I am not programming for my pleasure but I am trying to transfer my daily tasks to computer's back through my knowledge and skills. Sometime I think that modern programmers are successors of medieval alchemist because they have mostly the same targets: both development of philosopher's stone and creation of homunculus (the last one I like much more than the first one).</div>

I just made some small descriptions and screen-shots from old developments and applications in which development I took a part and which had some more or less rich GUI. For non-game applications I made some small reference, but for games only screen-shots.
